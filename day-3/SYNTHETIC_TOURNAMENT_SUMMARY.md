## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Correlated Attributes?
Real recipes that excel in taste often excel in other areas. The generator uses a base quality score with variation to create realistic correlations.

### Why Allow Upsets?
Real tournaments have surprises. The 15% upset probability in early rounds adds realism and excitement.

### Why Vary Vote Totals?
Real voting has natural variation. Using a range of 95-105 votes per match creates realism without perfect uniformity.

### Why Progressive Difficulty?
As weaker competitors are eliminated, remaining matches should be between high-quality recipes, leading to either close battles or dominant performances by the best.
